<p>Atlanta native Brent Fraim never intended to own an antique printing press from 1910. But you know what they say: Necessity is the mother of all invention. And in this case, the emphasis is on the word "mother."</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Fraim’s engraving press dates back to 1910, and the letterpress was built in 1970; the business owner says she’s also gained inspiration for her design and printing methods by exploring the archives of the J.P. Stevens Engraving Company, housed at the Atlanta History Center. </p>
<h3>The Growing Business</h3>
<p>Fraim had already launched social stationery business Dear Elouise in 2015, specializing in everything from wedding invitations to baby announcements. With Buckhead Printery, Fraim now uses the vintage letterpress and engraving machines to print her own products as well as those of others in the industry.</p></div>
<p>"These are antique machines. They’re hard to find. They’re hard to find people that can run them. And because of that, they produce these beautiful works of art," Fraim said.</p>
